[As](http://heartbleed.com/) [we're](http://thehackernews.com/2014/07/google-drive-vulnerability-leaks-users_9.html) [often](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/14/dropbox-pastebin/) [reminded](http://www.ibtimes.com/apple-icloud-hacked-millions-ios-83-passwords-targeted-part-white-hat-security-1960278), trust is bad.
So I'd like something that lets me avoid trusting cloud storage providers to keep my data safe.
I mean, they can try, but I'll help them :D

## Preliminaries

As far as encryption goes, (and in this context, hardware encryption wont do), we're looking at file-system based encryption.
I'm choosing ecryptfs:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils
```
So time to make this utility do what i want, some wierd behaviour:

  * By default, it mounts a secure partition on login, using the users auth key
  * Double-layer passwords, the encryption passphrase is wrapped by the auth passphrase
  * Maximum of one encrypted share per user
