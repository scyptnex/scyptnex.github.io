### Abstract ###

Context-Free Language Reachability (CFL-R) is a search problem to identify
paths in an input labelled graph that form sentences in a given context-free
language.  CFL-R provides a fundamental formulation for many applications,
including shape analysis, data and control flow analysis, program slicing,
specification-inferencing and points-to analysis.  Unfortunately, generic
algorithms for CFL-R scale poorly with large instances, leading research to
focus on ad-hoc optimisations for specific applications.  Hence, there is the
need for scalable algorithms which solve arbitrary CFL-R instances.

In this work, we present a generic algorithm for CFL-R with improved
scalability, performance and/or generality over the state-of-the-art solvers.
The algorithm adapts Datalog's semi-naive evaluation strategy for eliminating
redundant computations.  Our solver uses the quadtree data-structure, which
reduces memory overheads, speeds up runtime, and eliminates the restriction to
normalised input grammars.  The resulting solver has up to 3.5x speed-up and
60% memory reduction over a state-of-the-art CFL-R solver based on dynamic
programming.
