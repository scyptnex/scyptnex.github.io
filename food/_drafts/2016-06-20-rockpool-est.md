Enter the imposingly black-tiled and dimly shrouded _vault_ of the restaurant, detour past the modest bar for an abrasively bitter sans-rum cum-house-gin perfect storm, and await an eight course degustation (called 'tasting menu', because formal dining is out of style).
Impressed, though I was, and my time, though I enjoyed, initially off, though I was put, by a poor combination of ever-so-slightly tough bread with a ricotta and pear spread, so delicate and mild as to be flavourless on wholemeal bread, and emphasis-on-the-**kombu**/shiso butter, overcompensating for flavour almost as much as the pear was lacking it.

Fortunately the _real_ courses recovered, the first of which a cucumber and scampi salad(?), the subtle scampi fragrance with cucumber crunch pairing well with our sweeter sake.
Following this, a deconstructed sushi (aka donburi) of kingfish sashimi over mixed rice and ginger pieces served with soy and peach glaze, again with a sake, though this one far richer to match the stronger umami/salt of the soy glaze.
The steamed prawn-mousse cake(?), a tender and robust-flavoured panko-coated morsel, together with its ros√© pairing, a crisp and refreshing counter to the mousse's rich buttery ink-sauce, brings a sudden end to the asian influences.
A dry chardonnay provides the necessary sharp contrast to the next course, fish steamed in banana leaf, unfortunately let down by the following course, a hot-sweet-sour chicken dish, lacking in depth or subtlety and so failing to define itself apart from a decent takeout kung-pao.
Strategically (indeed, suspiciously strategic) placed grilled wagu follows the last stumble, with a rich oxtail sauce and token asian-fusion wasabi blob, alongside radicchio salad, which delighted my 6th-wine-addled, dissapointing-chicken-betrayed, aussie-bbq-loving palate for all the right reasons I'm sure.

A very memorable pandan custard with coconut meringue, lime granita and jasmine sorbet, cooling and refreshing with just the right amount of flaky meringue and smooth custard for sweetness, together with its noble reisling, was the prelude to the third unfortunate (and this time unrecoverable) offering, though at those levels of sobriety I only remember the muscat, the chocolate and the underwhelming.
Overall positive, though if not for capitalising on company's foodie-reputation-gift-voucher, this heavily subsidised return to the Perry franchise would have been harder to stomach.
