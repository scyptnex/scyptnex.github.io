Swanky dinner at the ironically named Ms. G's (or is it...), a little Asian-fusion tripple-decker number just round my corner in Potts Point.
Beginning with a sugar-sweet umeshu and mouth-watering ocean trout cerviche in nam-pla et al., and moving to stir fries of crispy-and savoury brussels/corn/mushrooms and gooey-rich spicy mapo tofu with beef and rice cake.
But the crown jewel definitely a slow braised pumpkin, unimaginably soft, and lacking that mouth-hijacking sweetness I normally dislike in pumpkin, balanced perfectly by a tangy and rich miso-sesame broth.

Unfortunately had to pass on some of the more *creative* desert options (Stoner's delight: marshmallow-bacon-caramel stack), but was a fan and will return.
