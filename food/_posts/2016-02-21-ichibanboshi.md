In the [ramen is a metaphor for life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9m6FoSw4jE) school of restauranting, there are no shortcuts.
Good ramen, broth stewed slowly over days to extract all the flavour, is a lesson in patience.
So it is, taking a number and waiting for your turn in this booking-averse local institution is a lesson in patience, and ramen.
How zen.

Two agonising re-reads of my menu under the undoubtedly judgemental eye of the waiter, I settle on Negi ramen, leaving Aburi-Chasu to company.
Add a side of Karaage though because I dont have to explain myself to you.
Truly, such god-given golden morsels, tender and juicy innards enrobed in a shatteringly crisp crust, kewpie mayo soothing the hint of mirin-miso-marinade in the flesh.
And this before the real reason we're all here.
Rich and warming broth, perfectly al-katame noodles, hosting that signature array of toppings, this time bamboo, sweet-corn, cha-siu and kombu.
Not to be outdone, company's generously-portioned lightly-charred _hunks_ of blow-torched pork-belly lending a pleasing smoky aroma to that stock, paired with a simpler selection of kombu and spring-onion.
Definite success this evening.
