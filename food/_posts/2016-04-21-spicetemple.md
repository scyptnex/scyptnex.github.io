With special thanks to company's old company for bankrolling this extravaganza, I was _quite_ happy to mooch.
And mooch I did, sipping zodiacally ordaned cocktails (Horse, but without the hay) in perhaps the nicest Japano-chique basement in Sydney.
Northern style lamb-fennel dumplings begin this treat, delicately flavoured innards for a multi-textured pan-fried tender-crispy shell.
A breif sake-interlude before the hot and numbing favourite, crispy duck, was unexpectedly ousted by the surprise champion, Yunnan style mushroom hotpot.
Dazzling assortment of shitake, enoki, oyster, cloud, wood-ear, and hereto unidentifed sponge one which soaked up and subsequently brothsploded your mouth with umami-laden soupy goodness.
Shame about the duck, a slab of one-dimensional flavour and uninteresting texture, where a lighter hand on the black-vinegar, or patience in roasting the notoriously tough meat might've saved it.
Paired both with the house fried rice, but the duck just left sour tastes and memories.
